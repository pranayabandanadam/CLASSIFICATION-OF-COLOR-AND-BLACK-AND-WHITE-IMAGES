A machine learning model for image classification was developed to distinguish between color and black-and-white images. The dataset consisted of 1,000 images, with an equal split of 500 color and 500 black-and-white images. The model achieved an accuracy of 91%. Various libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, and Scikit-learn were used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
